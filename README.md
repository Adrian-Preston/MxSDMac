# MxSDMac
*Mac tools for use with the Mendix Stream Deck content*

This project contains utilities for presentations using Elgato Stream Deck. This is used for using Stream Deck on a Mac. In addition to this repository you will also need Content repository ([https://github.com/MxEvangelists/MXSDContent](https://github.com/MxEvangelists/MXSDContent)). If you are using a Windows PC you will need the Windows support repository ([https://github.com/MxEvangelists/MXSDWindows](https://github.com/MxEvangelists/MXSDWindows)) instead of this one.

## Download

### First time download

These utilities must be installed under `/Users/Shared/MendixStream`. Make this folder on your Mac first if necessary. You may need to first enable access to the `/Users/Shared` folder as by default this is not accessible. Run the following commands to do this. You will probably be prompted to enter you Mac password by the `sudo` command.
```
cd /Users
sudo chmod 777 Shared
```

**_Note that sometimes you may find that your Mac mysteriously sets `/Users/Shared` back so that it is not accessible again. Just rerun the previous command to correct the situation._**

Download the latest utilities as follows:
```
cd /Users/Shared/MendixStream
git clone https://github.com/MxEvangelists/MXSDMac.git
```

### Update

You can pull the latest version of the utilities using:
```
cd /Users/Shared/MendixStream/MXSDMac
git pull
```

## Installation

No further action should be necessary.

## Configuration

If you have multiple screens connected to your Mac you may need to configure the presentations to appear on the correct one. To do this you need to follow this process:

1. Use the Stream Deck to run one of the Videos from the Content.
1. If the video appears on the correct screen then there is nothing further to do.
1. Otherwise, open the VLC menu on the Mac and select `Video/Fullscreen Video Device`. *If you can't see the VLC Menu on any screen then move the mouse right to the top of the screen showing the video and the VLC menu should roll down from the top.*
1. Choose one of the screen options on the list that appears. Which one may be evident from the dimensions shown, otherwise just choose one to try.
1. Nothing will change immediately. Close VLC (use the Stream Deck Close button or the VLC Menu Quit option.
1. Go back to stage 1.
